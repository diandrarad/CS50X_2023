Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: The top three teams in the
simulations (Germany, England, and United States) were all in the top six of the actual tournament, with the United
States winning the championship. However, the rankings of the other teams differ significantly, with some teams (such
as Canada and Japan) having lower chances of winning in the simulations than their actual rankings suggest, while
other teams (such as France and Netherlands) have higher chances of winning in the simulations than their actual
rankings suggest.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: The predictions is considered
"good enough" after around 1000 simulations because the fees will rise significantly higher after 1000 simulations.
