Given the high danceability (0.71646) and moderate energy level (0.65906) of their top 100 songs, it's possible that
this person's aura hue could be orange.

The aura is calculated may not be representative of the listener because (1) the top 100 songs may not be representative
of the listener's overall music preferences. It's possible that the listener has other favorite songs that didn't make
it into the top 100, which could affect the overall aura calculation. (2) The top 100 songs may not be diverse enough
to capture the listener's range of moods. If the listener tends to listen to songs with similar energy, valence, and
danceability levels, the aura calculation may not be very accurate. (3) The top 100 songs are only from 2018, so they
may not be representative of the listener's overall music preferences or moods.
To improve the accuracy of the aura calculation, we could consider using a larger sample size, such as the listener's
entire Spotify listening history, or a more diverse set of songs. We could also use more nuanced measures of mood, such
as sentiment analysis of song lyrics or user-generated playlists that are tagged with specific moods.
